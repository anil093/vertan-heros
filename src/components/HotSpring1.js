            It was an event that changed the course of history in the
            subcontinent. It brought together the nation as few other things
            could.The history of commemoration day traces back to 21st October
            1959, when a patrol party of CRPF, led by DSP Karam Singh, was
            ambushed by the Chinese forces at Hot Springs ladakh and 10 jawans
            were killed, the bravery and resultant sacrifice of jawans fighting
            at 16,000 ft. altitude, in extremely cold conditions and against all
            odds, is an epitome of the rarest of the rare courage Indo-Tibetan
            Border Police sends a representative party of all police forces, of
            the country, to Hot springs, Ladakh every year to pay homage to the
            martyrs who laid down their lives on 21st Oct, 1959 while guarding
            national frontiers. Their story has a beginning back in the late
            1950s. The Chinese had started, and completed, the construction of
            their strategic road through the traditional caravan route that
            passed from Sinkiang to Tibet through the Aksai Chin. It is common
            belief today that its construction had gone virtually unnoticed but
            the fact remained that several Indian Army reconnaissance parties as
            far back as 1952 (four years before the construction of the road
            began) had come across incriminating pieces of evidence that
            suggested the Chinese had such intentions in the region. One such
            patrol was conducted by Captain R. Nath, Captain Suri and a small
            detachment of soldiers from the Kumaon Regiment and the Laddakh
            Militia. This team went out from Leh in 1952 and headed through
            vastly barren mountainous terrain to reach a location called Hot
            Springs which was west of a critical mountain pass called Lanak La.
            It was here that they first came across reports from the locals that
            the Chinese were planning to build a road through the region and
            that Chinese engineers had been spotted conducting surveys in the
            region. Captain Nath and his team made it back safely to Leh and
            reported the Chinese intentions as well as the current lack of
            Chinese forces in the region. Despite the congratulations from the
            Ministry of Defense and Army Command, the team’s report was made
            secret and unfortunately, not acted upon. It should be noted that
            the team under Captain Nath and Captain Suri had reached Lanak La
            which lay at the traditional Laddakh-Tibet border and had
            encountered only scattered reports of Chinese engineers while no
            contact was made with any PLA unit. From this time in 1952 to around
            1955 the PLA presence in the region was minimal. Had the Indian
            government acted during these years and placed troops in the Aksai
            chin before PLA units moved into the region in around 1955, the
            outcome of the border dispute could have been vastly different. But
            the Indian government was going through a phase of friendly
            relations with the Chinese that made major decision makers from
            Nehru downwards blind to the cunning strategic plan the Chinese were
            enacting for the world. The first warning signs of increasing
            Chinese presence in the region were the increased “bumping” of
            Indian and Chinese troops in the region, though no exchange of fire
            took place. New Delhi ignored these new pieces of evidence as well
            the old ones in the name of maintaining friendly relations with
            China. Later, in October 1959, at the Governor’s conference, General
            Thimayya said that in 1957, after the road had been completed, he
            had proposed military steps to counteract the Chinese move but had
            been grounded by Defense Minister Krishna Menon on the grounds that
            China was a friend and that Pakistan was the “main military danger”.
            The fact that the Army Command and the Ministry of Defense knew of
            the Chinese intentions to build a road as far back as in 1952 when
            no Chinese troops were in the region and chose not to act on it
            suggests that the Indian Army in addition to the Ministry of Defense
            was not entirely free of guilt for the events that were to follow in
            the Aksai Chin. By 1957, the Chinese were in firm control of the
            Aksai Chin and faced only scattered Indian Armed police outposts in
            the region east of Leh. By this time the Chinese were certain of
            their position that an official announcement in Peiping was made on
            2ND September 1957 that the Aksai Chin road was to be completed in
            October of the same year. The announcement came forth in the
            People’s Daily which also presented a map of the region showing the
            Aksai Chin as Chinese territory.
