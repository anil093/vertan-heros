            The situation could now no longer be ignored in New-Delhi, but the
            strategic window to create an unopposed military presence in the
            region had now passed years ago.This was made clear to the Indians
            when one of the two reconnaissance patrols sent out in June 1958 to
            determine Chinese presence in the Aksai Chin, was captured by the
            Chinese in September of the same year as they neared the road. The
            treatment of the Indian prisoners was not proper. The patrol leader
            was in fact placed in solitary confinement during his interrogation
            before all of them were released. It reflects the complete fantasy
            that the Indian leaders had created around themselves regarding the
            military situation at the border that Prime Minister Nehru had
            personally ordered the men of these patrols to secure Chinese
            prisoners and detain them for questioning back in Leh or in case of
            a larger force, to “ask them to leave.” By late 1958, it was
            impossible for the Indian Army to be able to send a patrol all the
            way to the Lanak La without getting stopped and detained by the
            Chinese along the way. The PLA had not only moved into the Aksai
            Chin, they had secured vast regions of the plain west of where their
            strategic Sinkiang-Tibet road cut across the region. Further
            westward movements of troops were discovered when Chinese troops
            were detected as far west as Khunark Fort and Pangong Lake in the
            south. It is worthwhile to notice that such incidents were not
            publicly known at the time. Prime Minister Nehru’s aides have since
            reported his anxiety to maintain such a restriction on the release
            of such information to the public. The government also ensured that
            the information given out by the released members of the patrol that
            had been captured in 1958 regarding their treatment was not released
            to the public. The notes of exchange between Nehru and Chou also
            suggest that the Chinese leaders were just as pleased with such a
            restriction on release of information as Nehru, but for entirely
            different intentions altogether, though it is uncertain whether at
            that time Nehru knew their motives. As a result, as far as the
            Indian public was concerned, the Sino-Indian relations were going
            though a rough patch but nothing more. By summer of 1959 however,
            following the Tibetan revolt and the flight of the Dalai Lama to
            India, the moods had changed remarkably within different sections of
            the Indian government. Several crucial events happened in the summer
            of 1959 that was to set the stage for the later years. Prime
            Minister Nehru for one had finally begun to realize that the Chinese
            had been exploiting his genuine feeling of friendship with them .
            But his response was to ensure that further deterioration in the
            Sino-Indian relations did not take place. To this effect Indian
            officials were under strict instructions not to antagonize the
            Chinese . By September 1959, the ITBF forces in the region were
            coming under increased pressure from the Chinese forces at the
            border. In early September a patrol party of Indian soldiers was
            captured east of Chushul by the Chinese and released in the
            beginning of October near Chushul airbase. It was during this time
            of their being held prisoner that one ITBF officer, DSP Karam Singh,
            got orders from the Deputy Director of the Ministry of Home Affairs
            on 22ND September to establish new posts right at the Chinese
            occupation line in Laddakh. His first outpost was supposed to be at
            a place called Hot Springs. It was therefore that a full seven years
            after Captain R. Nath and Captain Suri had travelled through the
            same terrain and gone past Hot Springs all the way to Lanak La that
            the Indian Government ordered the deployment of lightly armed police
            forces to defend the border from a vastly experienced and battle
            hardened enemy army. This decision requires some scrutiny. It is
            worthwhile to remember that by this time there was sufficient
            evidence that heavily armed Chinese forces were deployed deep inside
            Indian Territory in Laddakh. The answer to the question as to why
            the Indian government chose to forward deploy lightly armed police
            units on shoestring logistical support to face this massive military
            force rather than Indian Army units brings out some bitter
            realities. The fact of the matter was that by this time in the
            dispute the Chinese were too far down the line in terms of
            deployment for the Indians to even begin to think about catching up.
            The nearest Army Garrison was at Leh. The only units available for
            the Indian Government to use to project force quickly were the ITBF
            and the CRPF units. But even then the picture is not complete. It
            needs to be mentioned that back on 13TH September, mere days after
            the capture of the Indian policemen near Chushul, Prime Minister
            Nehru had prohibited all forward patrolling in the Laddakh sector.
            And yet DSP Karam Singh had received orders to head east from Leh
            and prepare a line of new posts right opposite the Chinese forces.
            For all intents and purposes the jurisdiction of the operation was
            given to the ITBF units under DSP Karam Singh and a force of forty
            CRPF personnel deputed to the ITBF under DSP S.P. Tyagi. A few days
            after the release of the captured policemen near Chushul Airstrip in
            early October, this combined force of men, some sixty strong, moved
            out east from Leh on a week long trip through the high mountains on
            foot. Eventually they arrived at their destination at Hot Springs on
            19th October, a few kilometers west of the first known Chinese
            positions and established a temporary camp there.
