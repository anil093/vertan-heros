            Hot Springs in ladakh is situated between 15,000 and 16,000 ft above
            the sea level For DSP karam Singh and his company at the western
            front not only have to confront the intruding Chinese forces, but
            also have to fight against the worst natural environment and to
            overcome tremendous difficulties imposed by pleatu's frigid climate
            and lack of oxygen. The moutains are snow covered throughtout the
            year. The climate undergoes great variations;like violent snowstorms
            and at times sand storms accompained by rolling pebbles. Due to lack
            of oxygen, execution of the tasks like; building defense works,
            setting up posts and even walking was most difficult.Sometimes,
            because of the strong winds in the passes, there was no way to set
            up tents, the policemen had to dig snow caves and pits to hold fast
            to posts. Because of lack of oxygen, the boiling point of water was
            just 50-60 degrees celsius,making it difficult to cook food. men had
            to survive on frozen or canned food and drink water from snow.Some
            newly built posts had only a single tent with no heating equipment
            and fuel. During night,the policemen had to keep themselves warm by
            huddling togather. In such circumstances to fight against an army
            which is fully armed and ready for anything is a big thing of
            bravery which can not be ignored by anyone.
