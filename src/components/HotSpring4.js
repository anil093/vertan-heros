            On the morning of the 20TH, Karam Singh ordered a small
            reconnaissance party consisting of two constables and a porter to
            head east and report back on Chinese activities a few kilometers
            away. He intended to get an idea of the Chinese deployments in the
            region before attempting to move north and establish the first of
            the posts in the region. A common time was set up for this patrol to
            return. However, by late evening on the 20TH, there was still no
            sign of the two constables or the porter. Fearing that the small
            reconnaissance team might have lost their way, Karam Singh sent out
            a larger team of ten policemen to go out and look for the three lost
            men. This search party returned at 2300 hours that same night
            without being able to find of the three man patrol. They did,
            however, after travelling some ten kilometers, discover hoof-prints
            on the ground suggesting that the Chinese soldiers had been in the
            region. At 7am the next morning, the 21st of October 1959, Karam
            Singh and Tyagi led a team of around twenty policemen armed with
            bolt action rifles in search of the missing policemen and they left
            camp on ponies. The rest of the force was ordered to follow behind
            on foot. Karam Singh and his advance party reached the same region
            as the team the previous night had done and again found the
            hoof-prints. This time, however, Karam Singh, Tyagi and their small
            team dismounted and awaited the arrival of the main force. When the
            main party did arrive, it was decided that Tyagi would stay behind
            and command this larger force while Karam Singh and his small group
            of twenty would follow the tracks and see if they led to the Chinese
            intruders in that sector. It was at this point that the main force
            and the smaller advance team under Karam Singh lost sight of each
            other as a result of the hill feature along the bank of the Chang
            Chenmo River where the hoof-prints continued. Suddenly a Chinese
            officer was spotted on this hill overlooking both the teams as he
            waved to Karam singh to raise their hands and surrender. The Chinese
            had ambushed the entire force of Indian policemen. Now the Chinese
            were at an elevated position in fortified bunkers and trenches and
            armed with mortars and heavy machineguns looking down on an exposed
            Indian police force. But the brave Indian policemen were not ruffled
            by this show of force. Karam Singh lifted a handful of mitti(mud or
            soil) from the ground below where he stood to gesture to the Chinese
            officer that this was Indian soil. Apparently the Chinese officer
            did the same. Such back and forth gestures went on for three hours
            after which the Chinese officer disappeared from view a moment
            before a boulder rolled down from one of the Chinese bunkers higher
            up on the hill. A few seconds later there was a volley of fire from
            the hill above forcing the Indian policemen below to scramble for
            cover. Moments later Chinese positions on a nearby hill, so far
            undiscovered, also opened fire and caught the Indian troops in
            crossfire. Chinese heavy machineguns joined the fray as they poured
            fire on the beleaguered Indian policemen on the river bank below.
            Karam Singh’s men, armed with mere bolt action rifles, could not
            hope to survive this onslaught and it wasn’t long before his men
            started taking casualties. One of the members of his twenty force
            team, a constable named Ali Raza, managed to escape from the Chinese
            gunfire and run back and report to the main group under Tyagi as to
            what was happening. But Tyagi’s force was also under heavy attack
            and was pinned down. It was a massacre. Ten CRPF men in Karam
            Singh’s remaining force of nineteen were killed by evening while
            most others suffered some form of injury or another. One of the
            constables, Makhan Lal, was seriously injured by a bullet in the
            stomach. Faced with complete decimation of his men under the
            relentless Chinese gunfire, Karam Singh finally surrendered along
            with his nine wounded survivors later in the evening. The main force
            under Tyagi was forced to retreat and their attempts to recover the
            bodies of the dead CRPF men later in the night was in vain since
            many of the forty men under his command had also been wounded to
            some degree or another and the Chinese still dominated the hill
            above the riverbank which they continued to hold even on the 22nd
            October when Tyagi was finally ordered to retrieve his remaining
            force back to Tsogstsalu. Four of the more seriously injured
            policemen under Tyagi were airlifted to Srinagar on November 1st,
            1959 to be placed in a Military Hospital there. For Karam Singh and
            the other Chinese prisoners the tragedy had just begun. The
            following excerpts are taken directly from a description given by
            Karam Singh himself after being released :{" "}
            <Alert color="info">
              “Five of us were made to carry the dead body of the Chinese
              soldier who had been killed. Constable Rudra Man and I were asked
              to help Makhan Lal, who had been injured seriously in the abdomen.
              We carried him for two miles where the Chinese ordered us to leave
              him on the bank of the Chang Chenmo River. From this place I and
              Constable Rudra Man were made to carry heavy loads. We were
              completely exhausted and were finding it difficult to walk with
              this heavy load but we were repeatedly prodded by rifle butts to
              move on. “We reached the Chinese Kongka La post (above 16000 feet)
              at about 2 AM on the 22nd of October 1959. We were all put
              together in a pit six feet deep, seven feet wide and fifteen feet
              long, normally used for storing vegetables. It was covered with a
              tarpaulin which left several openings through which the ice-cold
              breezes penetrated. We had to spend the night on the frozen ground
              without any covering. No water for drinking was provided nor were
              we permitted to ease ourselves during the night and the following
              day. For the first three or four days we were given only dry bread
              to eat. The intensity of the cold and our conditions of living
              were more than sufficient torture to demoralize us. By then I and
              three constables were suffering from frostbite and our repeated
              requests for medical attention and hot water were disregarded.”
              Fresh snow was falling over the region on the 24th October when
              Karam Singh was shown the corpses of the Indian policemen killed
              during the gunfire and asked to indentify them. Then for the next
              twelve days he was tortured along with the others to make him
              admit that the Indians had opened fire and precipitated the
              skirmish:
            </Alert>
            At first they asked me to narrate the entire incident. As soon as I
            came to the point that the firing was opened by the Chinese, their
            senior officer present became wild and shouted back that it was
            incorrect and that I must confess that the Indians fired first. I
            refused to accept this despite repeated and constant threats that I
            would be shot dead. Ultimately they made me say that I could not
            judge at the time as to who fired first.” The Chinese also tried to
            make Karam Singh and the others admit that they had known before the
            incident that they had intruded into Chinese territory. Unable to
            get such a confession, the Chinese forged the statement attributed
            to Karam Singh to the effect that “I have now come to know that the
            area where the encounter had taken place is now under Chinese
            occupation.” Karam Singh reported that during his interrogation the
            Chinese attempted to make him confess that the Chinese officer who
            had made himself seen just before the incident had tried to warn
            them to leave. The basic idea behind all of this was of course to
            show that the Indians were the ones who had caused the incident and
            not the Chinese. The interrogation technique was extremely brutal:
            “This interrogation lasted from 4:00 AM to about 4:00 PM. By this
            time I was frozen and mentally and physically exhausted because of
            cold, persistent interrogation, intimidation, threats, angry
            shouting and lack of sleep. In this condition I was compelled to
            sign the statement recorded by the Chinese. At the end of this
            interrogation the Chinese then brought all the other captured
            personnel before me and read out the statement and several
            photographs were taken.” The interrogation continued on the 27th and
            28th when the Chinese extracted ORBAT information concerning the
            Indian border deployments. On the 28th all of the Indian policemen
            were taken to the bank of the Chang Chenmo River where photographs
            were taken by their captors as they washed the bodies of the dead
            comrades in accordance with custom. Photos were also taken of the
            prisoners being issued with warm clothing, padded in Chinese style .
            On the 29th Karam Singh and the others were taken to the original
            battle scene and forced to re-enact the events which had taken
            place. The incident was staged according to the Chinese version of
            the events while photographs were taken as evidence.
