          On November 7th 1959, an indoctrination lecture was delivered to the
          Indian prisoners while they were made to sit in the bitter cold of the
          Karakoram mountains. DSP Karam Singh of the ITBF (Left) and the
          Memorial (Right) for the policemen killed during the fighting on the
          21st of October 1959 still exists and serves as a pilgrimage visited
          every year by Policemen from across the country. On November 14th
          1959, Prime Minister Nehru’s birthday, the Chinese returned the three
          Indian policemen captured on October 20th along with Karam Singh and
          the rest of his surviving men. The bodies of the ten brave CRPF men
          were returned by the Chinese at the Indo-China border on November 13TH
          1959. The body of Constable Makhan Lal was never returned and remained
          unacknowledged by the Chinese. The last time he was seen was where the
          Chinese had forced Karam Singh and his men to leave his wounded body
          on the bank of the Chang Chenmo River under the protection of Chinesel
          soldiers. He was most likely neglected and died of his wounds but
          there are no confirmations of this ruthless act on the part of the
          Chinese. In a final act of humiliation, the Chinese allowed only ten
          Indian policemen to approach the actual Indo- China border. These ten
          men had to bring the bodies on horseback all the way back to Hot
          Springs. One of the constables of the ITBF who went along to collect
          the bodies was Sonam Wangyal, who had been in Tyagi’s main force
          during the original encounter on the 21st of October. He recollects
          the grim transfer ceremony :
