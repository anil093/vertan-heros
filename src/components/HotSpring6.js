            “Even while we were collecting the bodies, Chinese women in uniform
            were clicking photographs. The Chinese soldiers were wrapped in
            snow-white warm clothing and snow-boots while were in out woolen
            Angora shirts and jerseys, bearing the brunt of the biting cold at
            that prohibitive height of 16,300 feet.” Events in the outside world
            The day after Karam Singh and his group of survivors surrendered
            under the overwhelming Chinese fire, news of the incident began to
            filter out all the way to New-Delhi. On 23rd of October the Ministry
            of External Affairs submitted a note to the Chinese Ambassador in
            Delhi. This note represented the first official protest to the
            incident from the Indian Government. However, on the inside, Prime
            Minister Nehru and the Army Commanders had immediately come to
            realize that something else had happened. “On October 23rd, when the
            facts of the outrage came to be known, the Prime Minister held a
            meeting which was attended by the Defense Minister, the Chief of
            Army Staff and officers from the Ministry of External Affairs, Home
            and Defense. The Intelligence Bureau was made the common target by
            the Army Headquarters and the External Affairs Ministry and accused
            of expansionism and causing provocations at the frontier. The Army
            demanded no further movements of armed police should take place on
            the frontier without their clearance and the Prime Minister had to
            give in to the Army’s demand. The result was that protection of the
            frontier was thereafter handed over to the Army and all operations
            of the armed police were made subject to prior approval of the Army
            Command. On the 25TH, the Indian outposts in the region began
            receiving reinforcements and medical supplies as New-Delhi attempted
            to recover from the shock it had received. On the 27TH, the Chinese
            Foreign Ministry informed India and the world that it was prepared
            to release the captured Indian policemen “at any time”. The report
            also declared for the first time that India’s account of the facts
            had been “inconsistent with the facts and contrary to the truth”. It
            also rejected India’s claim for compensation for the families of the
            dead Indian policemen, adding that “if the question of compensation
            is to be raised, it is only the Chinese side, and not the Indian
            side, that has the right to make such a claim” . It was around this
            time that Karam Singh and the other Indian policemen were being
            tortured to extract the statements that they had intruded into
            Chinese territory. Consistent with this fact, the first Chinese
            claims that India had provoked the incident began to surface in
            various Chinese state media. On November 1st, 1959, the Indian Army
            took over direct command of the frontier with China, relieving the
            ITBF and CRPF forces in the region in this role. The Indian Army
            announced that a chain of outposts would now be built and troops
            would be placed there. This was in effect the beginning of what was
            later to become the notorious ‘Forward Policy’. The Chinese declared
            in a threatening note that should Indian Army enter Laddakh, it
            would make a “fresh entry” south of the MacMahon line. The
            importance of this statement cannot be understated for any future
            war with china. Indeed, it was a culmination of this statement that
            was brought about by the Forward Policy in the next few years that
            led to the Chinese attack on 20th October 1962. It was the Kongka La
            incident that brought the Indian public finally into the picture.
            There were mass protests on the streets asking for the dismissal of
            Krishna Menon as Defense Minister as also denouncing the Chinese.
            The Kongka La incident was already causing tempers to flare in India
            but in the coming days when Karam Singh and his men would be
            released, and their story would finally pour out, the effect would
            boil over. It was one of the most crucial events leading up to the
            1962 war. The Hindustan Times wrote: “Inaction now can make war
            inevitable” while the Indian Express had a statement about Nehru
            that he had “sadly underestimated the real menace of Han
            expansionism and Communist Imperialism.” Public display of anger as
            protestors burn a copy of China Today in New Delhi after the 21
            October incident while others demand the resignation of Defense
            Minister Krishna Menon in response to the loss of Indian lives in
            Laddakh Nehru however, was under no illusion regarding the imbalance
            of the armed forces of India and China when he discussed the
            incident at a public forum on the 25TH of October 1959, just days
            after the event. He temporized during the discussion and warned
            against rash action such as counterattacks etc being demanded by
            others. Other called on him to reject the non-alignment policy and
            join the west against the threat of communism as also to allow a
            significant buildup of military strength with help from the US and
            UK. Nehru flat out denied the abandoning of the non-alignment policy
            and reaffirmed this stand on a 1ST November public forum meeting.
            Instead he was quoted as saying that India would defend herself
            “with all her might”, although most members of the Indian Military
            took this with a grain of salt faced as they were with harsh
            realities of the situation at 16000 feet. Nehru also attempted to
            explain to the Indian public why the border in Laddakh had not been
            defended with more forces with a feeble (yet infamous) response: “We
            thought that the Chinese would not resort to force in the Ladakh
            area…”
            <Alert color="info">
              And at 8:00 AM on November 14th 1959, the bodies of the CRPF men
              were laid to rest with full police honors at Hot Springs in
              Ladakh, Jammu & Kashmir. Since 1961, the spot is a place of
              pilgrimage for policemen from all over the country who pay homage
              to the martyrs there. Karam Singh received a national hero’s
              welcome. He was awarded the President’s Police Medal by Prime
              Minister Nehru himself. Since then October 21st is remembered as
              the Police Commemoration Day all over India. It is a fitting
              tribute to those brave men who laid down their lives in defense of
              the country and their comrades who suffered under extraordinary
              conditions at the hands of the Communist Chinese soldiers almost
              fifty six years ago. The Annual Conference of Inspectors General
              of Police of States and Union Territories held in January 1960
              decided that October 21 would, henceforth, be observed as
              Commemoration Day in all Police Lines throughout India to mark the
              memory of these gallant men who were killed in Ladakh and all
              other police personnel killed on duty during the year. It was also
              decided to erect a memorial at Hot Springs. Every year, members of
              police forces from different parts of the country trek to Hot
              Springs to pay homage to those gallant martyrs.
